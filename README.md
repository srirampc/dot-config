# dot config files

Configuration files for :

- neovim/astrovim (avim/)
- specific LSPs (lsp_config)
- vim in Windows (win)
- tmux (tmux)
- bash (bash)

## Notes

- No longer using `fish` because it causes significant slowdown with many neovim packages.
- Changed from lunarvim to astrovim as it satisfies most requirements.
